# Crime Pay

#### It's a play to earn game (P2E) in development phase that mixes the crime world with pixel art and comical elements.

The player is challenged to live a day-to-day life of a character who can be a policeman, a thief or a businessman. The thief will try his luck to rob all kinds of establishments, for that, it is necessary to equip with some bests weapons on the market. When not stoned, make some heists that Hollywood films envy. The Dealer provides thieves with fun and pleasure. With freshly picked herbs and top quality synthetics, it allows the thief to continue working actively. Some dealers become real pimps with a menu of whores of all heights and ages. Within this world, not everything is easy and it is far from peaceful. The police are on the street patrolling and can arrest them at any time. Pray you don't get arrested, because you could lose everything.
